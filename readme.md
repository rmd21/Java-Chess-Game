# CHESS
<hr>
Personally one of my favourite games and something I love to play during my me time since childhood. Hopefully you all are familiar with chess and how it works but just incase please do read the <a href= "https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess">rules</a> if required. <br>

## Instructions
It is a basic terminal implementation of the game following all the chess rules mentioned above. In order to move your piece across the board simply type the starting position of your piece and then the ending position once prompted by the terminal.

## Running the Game
Once you have downloaded my repo, ```cd``` your way into this directory and then type ```./run.sh``` on the terminal to run the code 

### Enjoy the game with your friends !!!
